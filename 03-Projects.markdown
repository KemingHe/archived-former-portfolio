_Welcome to a list of my Signature Projects. You can view updates of ongoing project in the [Home](../.) page, under "Posts". Projects are great ways for me to learn, build, and help people outside my curriculum._<br/><br/>

* ### Sixth Sense Project
Where 3 young talents set off to help the visually impaired with computer vision, a mobile app, and vibrating wristbands. Currently building the Minimal Viable Product, next step is research.
