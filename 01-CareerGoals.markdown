_My goals in life is to harness the power of technology and to help those in need._

### Background

I am passionate about computer science, so I became the first in my family to go abroad and to pursue a degree in Computer Science and Engineering in the United States. My multi-culture background gives me an open mindset, and urges me to try and accept new ideas in the industry. 

### Passion

I am a project-driven person. My greatest passion in life is learning and building, or research and development. In summer 2019, I interned at Genome Wisdom, a biotech startup focused on cancer data analytics in Beijing, China. Introduced to the agile team mid-development, I made friends with colleagues and quickly picked up Python. At the time, Genome Wisdom was building medical image-processing libraries to help with real-world immuno-therapy. It had been an honor for me to develop an auto-documentation system for our code base, as well as to help patent 4 algorithms.

### Forward

In 20 years, I envision myself as a back-end senior developer in the fields of software engineering and artificial intelligence. Itâ€™s likely for me to be working with health professional on biotech solutions to real-life patients. I intend to provide not only functional service, but also good service to my clients, especially in terms of quality, stability, and accessibility. This career track will carry on my passion for research and development, as well as real-world problem-solving. Though working in the interdisciplinary field of computer science and medical involves great ethical responsibilities, I shall make it thorough with great effort, knowledge and pure intentions.
