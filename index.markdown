# Learn to Build, Build to Help.

![ProfilePic](./assets/images/headshot4_smaller.png){: .image-left target="_blank" height="33%" width="33%"} Hello! My name is Keming He. I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at The Ohio State University, graduating in May, 2022. My most recent projects involve **machine learning**, **Android app dev**, and **game design**. 

I enjoy being proactive and working with talented people in dynamic environments. I am fluent in both **English** and **Mandarin Chinese**, with experience working in both Columbus, OH and Beijing, China. Learning is my passion, and my ultimate goal is to help people with my software and services, built from state-of-the-art technologies.

I am always looking for new opportunities to network and collaborate. You are welcome to look at my Career Goals, my Resume, and my **Signature Projects posted below**. Please reach out to me via [email](he.1537@osu.edu) if you have any questions.
