### Overview
In Spring 2019 semester, Team P and I researched and developed an Advanced Energy Vehicle (AEV) for the [Smart City Columbus](https://smart.columbus.gov/projects) staff, as part of [ENGR 1182](https://eed.osu.edu/first-year-engineering-program)'s curriculum. Our AEV is driven by two opposite-facing propellers, attached to a single-piece main support frame. It would stop at gates, pick up cargo, and carry it to base. In the end, our model achieved 50% less energy consumption compared to class average; and our presentation won **Second Place** among the entire SP19 semester class. (You can view the official announcement in the Related Links section below.)

### Research and Development
At Team P, I was the Reseach and Development Lead, as well as Project Manager for the AEV. I used **SOLIDWORKS** for computer-assisted design, and went through **10+ iterations** of the main support frame. I **laser-cut** all of our designs, and tested each one with the team to find the best solution. The final single-piece support frame won **top-rated design** in the Custom-Vehical-Part contest, resulting in us receiving **full funding** for its cost of manufacturing.

Midway through the development, I also developed a **plug-and-play position display module** for our test vehicle, shown in Figure 1 below. The module was made out of a market-available LCD module, wiring, and coffee stir sticks for quick attachment. I modified our given vehicle source code to both provide power to the external module, and to print out the current position. In the end, the module helped us decide on using time instead of position data for programming the vehicle. This decidion not only **improved accuracy**, but also **simplified our original code**.

### Conclusion
The AEV is a semester-long project that tested all of my engineering skills. It opened my eyes to the real-world R&D process. More importantly, I learned to work efficiently and effectively together with people of different skillset and background. Teamwork played a huge role in the success of this project, and I want to give thanks to my teammates: Nick, Jon, and Zach for their support. You can see a selfie of the team in Figure 2 below. Lastly, I would like to thank our instructor, [Mr. Cohen](https://eed.osu.edu/people/cohen.507), for giving me this wonderful opportunity to work hard and to achieve.
