### Overview
In Spring 2019 semester, Team P and I researched and developed an Advanced Energy Vehicle (AEV) for the [Smart City Columbus](https://smart.columbus.gov/projects) staff, as part of [ENGR 1182](https://eed.osu.edu/first-year-engineering-program)'s curriculum. Our AEV is driven by two opposite-facing propellers, attached to a single-piece main support frame. It would stop at gates, pick up cargo, and carry it to base. In the end, our model achieved 50% less energy consumption compared to class average; and our presentation won **Second Place** among the entire SP19 semester class.

### Research and Development
At Team P, I was the Reseach and Development Lead, as well as Project Manager for the AEV. I used **SOLIDWORKS** for computer-assisted design, and went through **10+ iterations** of the main support frame. I **laser-cut** all of our designs, and tested each with the team to find the best solution. The final single-piece support frame won **top-rated design** in the Custom-Vehical-Part contest, resulting in us receiving **full funding** for its cost of manufacture.

Midway through the development, I also developed a **plug-and-play position display module** for our test vehicle, shown in Figure 1 below. The module was made out of a market-available LCD module, wiring, and coffee stir sticks for quick attachment. I modified our given vehicle source code to both provide power to the external module, and to print out the current position. In the end, the module helped us decide on using time instead of position data for programming the vehicle. This decidion not only greatly **incresed accuracy**, but also **simplified 75% of our original code**.
