#### Overview

Save Brutus! is a MATLAB hangman game made in the [ENGR 1181](https://eed.osu.edu/first-year-engineering-program) course as part of the Software Design Project (SDP). I was one of the four members of Team M, and my responsibilities are programming lead and documentation. Our inspiration came from the friendly rivalry between the [Ohio State Buckeyes](https://ohiostatebuckeyes.com/sports/m-footbl/) and the [Michigan Wolverines](https://mgoblue.com/sports/football) football teams. And we planned on marketing the game as a family-friendly, home-team-spirtied pastime during the 2018 college football season. I also designed a printed advertisement for Save Brutus, seen in Figure 1 below.

#### Conclusion

The project introduced me to the software development pipeline. I went from market resreach/interviews to initial prototyping, and finaly to polishing the product and giving our business pitch in class.

#### Introduction
The Bird Advanture Game is a single-stage platforming demo made **under 6 hours** using [Unity](https://unity.com/). I developed the game for the Autumn 2019 "Connections" game jam, hosted by [Ohio State's Game Creation Club](http://org.osu.edu/gamedev/). Bird Advanture is my **first** Unity project, it introduced game design to me as a creative hobby.

#### Behind-the-Scene
The game uses open-source scripts and background textures from the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/). In addition, I designed, created, and implemented the Running, Jumping, Flying, and Idle animations of the main character <img src="../../../../assets/images/BirdJumping(3frames).gif" alt="Bird Jumping" height=16px width=16px>, using [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/). You can catch a glimpse of my Unity Workspace in Figure 3 below.

#### Forward
Since Project Bird Advanture, game design has become my creative outlet. The development process brings art, music, design, programming, and business all together. And the independent game community is where I get to meet fun and talented people. If you are also insterested in this topic, please stay tuned to my project posts for updates and sharing.
